intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a computer science major, currently working on my Bachelor's at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), class of 2023. Getting a job in the tech industry has been my lifelong goal, and I've been programming since a very young age.

    title: "Works Well With Others"
    excerpt: "Everyone says this out of necessity, but in my case I really believe that it is true: I work well with others, and enjoy working as part of a team. I am good at coordination, and will naturally step up to fill leadership roles when necessary and acceptable."

    title: "Flexibility"
    excerpt: "I've worked with a lot of technology, both for school and on side projects. That includes web development technology, such as Node.JS, React, Redux, Ember.JS, Firebase, and TypeScript, as well as back-end technologies, including Go, Python, and Java, and systems programming langauges such as Rust and C++. I've learned that once you undertand the basic underlying concepts of programming, one can rapidly adapt to the requirements of any job."

    title: "Empathy"
    excerpt: "I enjoy helping others with their problems, and am more than willing to go out of my way to establish relationships of mutual benefit and trust wherever possible.
